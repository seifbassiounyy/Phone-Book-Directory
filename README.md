# Phone-Book-Directory

## Overview

This program is about a telephone book which contains all of the information of a contact, such as: first name, last name, date of birth, address, email, and phone number. Firstly, the user will be asked to enter the file’s name which contains the desired phone book. After that, the main menu of the program will appear on the screen for the user to start using it. A user could easily change the phone book (file) they want to use by loading another file. You can search any contact you would like to know its full information, as well as adding a new person with all of their information to the telephone book. Also the user has the option to remove any contact from the list. In addition, you can modify any of the existing contact’s information. It is also possible that you can print all the data of the contacts sorted by their last name or date of birth based on your choice. Most importantly you can easily save what you chose to do and anything you would save will automatically appear in the telephone book (file). Certainly, there is an option if the user would like to quit the program. 

## Sample Runs and User Manual
